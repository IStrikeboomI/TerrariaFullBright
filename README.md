# Fullbright For Terraria!
Tired of not being able to see? Well just download and run one program so you can see everything!

## Download
To download, go to the side bar and under "Releases" where it says (Release.exe), and click it
Then click "TerrariaFullBright.exe" and allow download

Or [just use this direct download link](https://github.com/IStrikeboomI/TerrariaFullBright/releases/download/1.0/TerrariaFullBright.exe)

## How To Use
Make sure Terraria is open before running
When you see "Enjoy Fullbright", use Shift+F6 to toggle fullbright
If this doesn't work, reset both programs (make sure Terraria opens first) and try again
